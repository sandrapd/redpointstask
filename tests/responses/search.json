The film marks a critical development in the artist's work in that he repeatedly employs a series of rapid pans and upward tilts along the city's buildings or facades, often integrating glimpses of his own face. As Beavers notes in his writing on the film, the camera movements are tied to the filmmakers' presence and suggests his investigative gaze.",

She secretly wrote to each of her seven children journals documenting 57 years, from their birth to the day she died. It was her life's work. Every evening she would sit in her home in Kibbutz Ein Tzurim and write to her children, whom she had never hugged nor kissed.  Now, they open the journals for the first time. Following the treasure she left behind, they embark on an emotional and painful journey, learning about childhood, motherhood, and parenting.",
